		\begin{enumerate}
			\item   WSANs consists of two classes of components: sensors and actors.
			\item  The phenomena of sensing and acting are performed by sensor and actor nodes
			\item  These two classes of components have the following distinct characteristics:.
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Sensor :
				\begin{itemize}
					\item low-cost, low-power devices with limited sensing
				    \item A sensor node may consist of multiple sensors and observe
				    different physical phenomena through these sensors
			\item Actor :
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Resource-rich nodes equipped with higher processing capabilities, higher transmission power, and potentially longer battery life
					\item Actors may be mobile improves the effective areas in which they can act
					\item An actor node may be embedded with different actuators to perform different tasks
					\item By communicating multiple actors can coordinate to decide on appropriate actions based on information received from multiple sensors.
				\end{itemize}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item WSANs have the following unique characteristics:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Heterogeneity: 
						\begin{itemize}
							\item WSANs consist of heterogeneous components including low-end sensor nodes and more powerful actor nodes.
							\item heterogeneous sets of network protocols are required
						\end{itemize}
						\item Real Time requirement :
						\begin{itemize}
							\item  WSANs are essentially closed-loop systems, where decisions are made according to the input from the sensors
							\item Example in the fire monitoring application, if a fire is detected, the sensors should relay this information to the appropriate sprinklers to immediately put out the fire. 
							\item The collected and delivered sensor data must still be valid at the time of acting
						\end{itemize}
						\item Co ordination
							\begin{itemize}
								\item In WSANs, new networking phenomena called sensor–actor and actor–actor coordination 
								\item

							\frametitle{Characteristics of WSANs}
							\begin{enumerate}
								\item WSANs consist of sensor and actor nodes which collect data from the environment
								\item perform appropriate actions based on these collected data
							\end{enumerate}
								\end{frame}
								\begin{frame}
								\frametitle{NETWORK ARCHITECTURE}
								\begin{enumerate}
									\item WSANs can be organized into two main architectures. 
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Automated architecture:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item  sensors send their observations to actors.
										\item  The actors coordinate among each other to decide on the appropriate action and perform task assignment.
										\item  Due to the non-existence of a central controller, e.g., sink or human interaction, this architecture is called automated.
										\item  The observations are distributed among actors and they need to coordinate to make decisions
							            \item Advantages: 
							            \begin{itemize}
							            	\item Lower latency : communication of the observed information from sensors to actors has a much smaller latency compared to sending this information to the sink.
							            	\item Longer Network Lifetime: The automated architecture results in localized communication, where the sensor observations are delivered to the nearby actors
							            	This load will be generally small
							            	As a result, the automated architecture will have a longer lifetime than the semi-automated
							            	architecture.
							            	\item Lower network resource consumption: the number of sensors involved in the communication process in the automated architecture is smaller than that in the semi-automated architecture.
							            	 The network load is distributed and is based on the locations of the events.
							            	  This results in network resource (i.e., energy, bandwidth, etc.) savings inWSANs.
							            \end{itemize}
								\end{itemize}
								\item Semi-automated architecture: 
								\begin{itemize}
									\item In this the sink, i.e., central controller collects data and
									coordinates the acting process.
									\item Disadvantage: the semi-automated architecture is prone to single points of failure, where the failure of the sink affects all the tasks in the network

										\frametitle{Sensor–Actor Coordination}
										\begin{enumerate}
											\item The most important requirement of sensor–actor coordination is to provide low communication delay due to the proximity of sensors and actors.
											\item The three main
											challenges arise for this coordination:
											\begin{itemize}
												\item Requirements of sensor–actor communication
												\item Actor selection
												\item Communication technique
											\end{itemize}

									\begin{frame}
										\frametitle{ACTOR SELECTION}
										\begin{enumerate}
											\item there are four alternatives for actor selection
											\begin{itemize}
												\item Minimum actor set: A minimal set of actors to cover the event region.												• \item Minimum sensor set: The minimum number of sensors to report the sensed event.
												\item Minimum actor and sensor set: Both cases above.
												\item Area-based set: The entire set of actors and sensors in the vicinity of the region.

											\frametitle{Challenges for Actor–Actor Coordination}
											\begin{enumerate}
												\item A communication model is needed between actors. 
												\item If the distance between neighbor actors is larger than the transmission range, they cannot directly communicate with each other
												\item Actors use sensor nodes as intermediaries, which means that actor–actor coordination is performed via sensor nodes
												\item Ordered execution of tasks for a series of events are required to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the target environment
												\item Require synchronization of actors to act on the event at the same time. The actors have to coordinate either in a distributed or centralized fashion to determine the time of execution of the task
												\item based on the location of the event, the actors receiving the event information forward it to a different set of actors corresponding to the estimated new position of the event
												\item Necessary to address the redundancy in the set of actors that performs a task  to save  the average energy consumed by the actors in the region
												\item Necessary for only a subset of actors covering the entire event region to be selected to carry out the task
												\item The challenge is to select the actor which will function as a decision unit. 
												\item Need for an effective mechanism to provide the decision unit actor with knowledge of the current characteristics eg: location,capability
												\item So that it can trigger the most appropriate actors for the task
												\item The most important requirements of actor–actor coordination is to minimize the task completion time.
												\item Coordination and communication protocols should support real-time properties of WSANs.

											\frametitle{WSAN PROTOCAL STACK}
											\begin{enumerate}
												\item The protocol stack for sensor and actor nodes consists of three planes: 
												\begin{itemize}
													\item Communiaction plane 
													\item Coordination plane
													\item Management plane
												\end{itemize}
												 
											\end{enumerate}
										\end{frame}
											\begin{frame}
												\frametitle{MANAGEMENT PLANE}
												\begin{enumerate}
													\item Responsible for monitoring and controlling a sensor/actor node so that it operates properly.
													\item  It also provides information needed by the coordination layer to make decisions
													\begin{itemize}
														\item Power management plane 
														\item Mobility management plane
														\item Fault Management plane
													\end{itemize}
													
												\end{enumerate}
											\end{frame}
											\begin{frame}
												\frametitle{CO ORDINATION PLANE}
												\begin{enumerate}
													\item determines how a node behaves according to the data received from the communication plane and management plane
													\item provides nodes to be modeled as a social entity, i.e., in terms of the coordination and negotiation techniques it possesses
													\item At each sensor node, the exchanged data are submitted to the coordination plane for decisions.
													\item Accordingly, sensors are able to coordinate among themselves on a higher level sensing task
														
												\end{enumerate}
											\end{frame}
											\begin{frame}
												\frametitle{MANAGEMENT PLANE}
												\begin{enumerate}
													\item The functions performed by the management layer can be categorized into the following three areas:
													
													\begin{itemize}
														\item POWER MANAGEMENT
														\begin{itemize}
														\item This plane manages how a node uses its power. 
														\item For example, when the power level of a node is low, this plane informs the coordination plane so that the node will not participate in sensing
														\end{itemize}
														\item Mobility management plane:
														This plane detects and registers the movements of nodes so thatnetwork connectivity is always maintained.
														\item Fault management plane: 
														This plane refers to the detection and resolution of node problems.
														For example, when the sensitivity of a sensing unit or the accuracy of the actuation unit degrades, the fault management plane informs the coordination plane about this
