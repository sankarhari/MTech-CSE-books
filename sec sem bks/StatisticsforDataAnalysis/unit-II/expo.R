Exponential Distribution

Suppose the mean checkout time of a supermarket cashier is three minutes. Find the probability of a customer checkout being completed by the cashier in less than two minutes.

heckout processing rate is equals to one divided by the mean checkout completion time. Hence the processing rate is 1/3 checkouts per minute. We then apply the function pexp of the exponential distribution with rate=1/3.

pexp(2, rate=1/3)
